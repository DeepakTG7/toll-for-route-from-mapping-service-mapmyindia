# [MapmyIndia](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/)

### Get API key to access MapmyIndia (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Get API Key
* Create an account to access [MapmyIndia API Dashboard](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/dashboard)
* go to [signup/login](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/login)

#### Step 2: Getting you key
* Once you are logged in, go to [MapmyIndia API Dashboard](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/dashboard)
* You will be presented with different keys, the key that we are looking
  for is `REST API Key for Web/Android/iOS`

With this in place, make a GET request: https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v1/#{KEY}/route_adv/driving/#{SOURCE[:longitude]},#{SOURCE[:latitude]};#{DESTINATION[:longitude]},#{DESTINATION[:latitude]}?geometries=polyline&overview=full

### Note:
* REQUEST should include `geometries` as `polyline` and `overview` as `full`.
* Setting overview as full sends us complete route. Default value for `overview` is `simplified`, which is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions.
* MapmyIndia accepts source and destination, as semicolon seperated

using System.IO;
using System.Net;
using RestSharp;

# Source Details - New Delhi coordinates
SOURCE = { longitude: '77.18609677688849', latitude: '28.68932119156764' }
# Destination Details - Mumbai coordinates
DESTINATION = { longitude: '72.89902799500808', latitude: '19.092580173664984' }

# GET Request to MapmyIndia for Polyline
        public static string get_Response(string source_latitude,string source_longitude, string destination_latitude, string destination_longitude){
            string api_key="API-Key-MapMyIndia";
            string url = "https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v1/"+api_key+"/route_adv/driving/"+source_longitude+","+source_latitude+";"+destination_longitude+","+destination_latitude+"?geometries=polyline&overview=full";
            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(url);
            WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
            String polyline;
            using (Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream())
            {
                StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(dataStream);
                string responseFromServer = reader.ReadToEnd();
                Console.WriteLine(responseFromServer);
                string[] output = responseFromServer.Split("\"geometry\":\"");
                string[] temp = output[1].Split("\"");
                polyline=temp[0];
            }
            response.Close();
            return(polyline);
```
Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from MapmyIndia API

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to [receive a free key from TollGuru](https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key)
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day.

the last line can be changed to following

```.net
# Sending POST request to TollGuru
            var client = new RestClient("https://dev.tollguru.com/v1/calc/route");
            var request1 = new RestRequest(Method.POST);
            request1.AddHeader("content-type", "application/json");
            request1.AddHeader("x-api-key", "");
            request1.AddParameter("application/json", "{\"source\":\"mapmyindia\" , \"polyline\":\""+polyline+"\" }", ParameterType.RequestBody);
            IRestResponse response1 = client.Execute(request1);        
            var content = response1.Content;
            //Console.WriteLine(content);
            string[] result = content.Split("tag\":");
            string[] temp1 = result[1].Split(",");
            string cost = temp1[0];
            return cost;

```
